# Computer Architecture 306

The repository contains the sessional works I and my friends did in **Computer Architecture Sessional (CSE 306)** course in BUET Level 3 Term 1.

## offline_1
### 4 bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design


## offline_2
### Floating Point Adder Design

## offline_3
### 8 Bit MIPS Design
Create an "input.txt" file which will contain the 8086 assembly code. Compile it with the CPP file and a machine code will be generated. Load the bin file in the ROM (Instruction Memory) of the circuit.
Load the "control_unit.bin" in the Control Unit ROM.  

## offline_4
### 8 Bit MIPS Pipelined Execution
Create an "input.txt" file which will contain the 8086 assembly code. Compile it with the CPP file and a machine code will be generated. Load the bin file in the ROM (Instruction Memory) of the circuit.
Load the "control_unit.bin" in the Control Unit ROM.
